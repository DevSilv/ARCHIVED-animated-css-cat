      <h1>About the website and the author</h1>
      <p>This website is intended to present an animated cat.</p>
      <p>To see the cat, click any of the links in the main menu with the word
        "cat".</p>
      <p>I (me, silvuss) am the author of this website. This website is
        published by courtesy of the <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub
          Pages</a> hosting. You can find sources of this website <a href="TODO">in
          its repository on my GitHub account</a>.</p>
      <h1>About the cat</h1>
      <p>
        The cat is animated only using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS
          language</a> in 3 ways:
        <ul>
          <li>using only CSS;</li>
          <li>using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_(stylesheet_language)">Sass
              language</a> (with the SCSS syntax), compiled then to CSS;</li>
          <li>using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Less_(stylesheet_language)">LESS
              language</a>, compiled then to CSS.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>The Sass and LESS versions differ in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar">syntactic
          sugar</a>. You can find the broader descriptions which features of
        these languages are used in the <a href="TODO">README</a>.</p>
      <p>There are two animations that the cat is expected to show: <strong>moving
          its tail</strong> and <strong>cleaning its paws</strong>. The tail
        shall move every 5 seconds, and both the paws shall be cleaned every 20
        seconds.</p>
      <p>I am not an expert on cats. When I was creating the tail animation,
        unfortunately, I forgot to look for any information of the behavior of
        cats. Therefore, the moves that the cat is making with its tail are not
        to be strictly classified; I think that they may seem to indicate
        something like playful mood (according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_communication#Tail">this
          Wikipedia's article on cat</a>).
